Welcome to my JS practice repo!
This is a personal repo just for me to practice writing JS code and Mocha tests.

To run them, you'll need node.js, mocha, and chai:
```
npm install node
npm install mocha
npm install chai
```

## Table of contents (functionality and tests listed in respective READMEs):

### Coinflip
A simple coin flip simulation. Flip a coin 10 times and get the results.

### Hangman
A game of hangman. 7 tries to guess the word! Can you guess the word?

### Math
A list of math functions for practicing writing simple Mocha tests and JS syntax.
